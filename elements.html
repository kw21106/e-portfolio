												<h3>Seminars</h3>
												<p>Seminar 1</p>
												<p>In the seminar, we have created a slide with a DREAD analysis which is featured the three most possible vulnerabilities:</p>

												<p>I also have responsed to further questions:
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%202%20Seminar%20idea.pdf</p>
												<p>Additional mitigations for wireless network, comparing with the wired network:</p>
												<p>-	Deploy stateful firewall and IDS before the hot spots</p>
                                                                                                <p>-	Deploy address filtering</p>
                                                                                                <p>-	Use static ARP tables for the Wi-Fi network</p>

	               										<p>Seminar 2</p>
											        <p>I have created the draft for the presentation, including the basic tools/scanners we have tried, and how will the information shape our pen test:</p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%204%20Seminar%20idea.pdf</p>
                                                                                                <p>And my team mate has created a presentation, with additional information:</p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%204%20Seminar%20TCPIP%20Tool%20Scans.pdf</p>
												<p></p>
												<p>Seminar 5</p>
												<p>I have chosen Sina Weibo from China,  for the data breach case study. Although I did not present, but I have prepared the responses of the questions:</p>
												<p>Q: What types of data were affected?</p>
												<p>A: Users’ all real information, including names, gender, phone numbers, email addresses and locations, such as where they are working and living.</p>
												<p>Q: What happened?</p>
												<p>A: Every personal data was leaked and collected by third party and being sold in the underground market with check price, from £200 up.</p>
												<p>Q: Who was responsible?</p>
												<p>A: Never mentioned. In fact, you won’t know who needed to be responsible and everything is covered inside China. </p>
												<p>Q: Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?</p>
												<p>A: Nothing mention due to the blockage of information inside China.</p>
												<p>Q: Was the ICO notified?</p>
												<p>A: Again, no information about this.</p>
												<p>Q: Were affected individuals notified?</p>
												<p>A: Obviously, they won’t be noticed, which is one of the policies of Chinese dictatorship – “maintaining stability of the society”. They may be noticed from 3rd parties privately, or underground.</p>
												<p>Q: What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?</p>
												<p>A: Of course, no. “Maintaining the stability of society” is the 1st priority of the Chinese Government’s policy, as it is a dictatorship. </p>

												<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h3>
												<p>My initial post has made a summary and outcome of the basic network scanning. Also have discussed the possible security threats on every aspect.</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=258333</p>
												<p>About the peer response, in addition of MTR, ping and tracert, I have suggested more advanced, graphical network testing tool, which can provide a more accurate and detail of every network analyse data:</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=259211</p>
												<p>I also have suggested use the WHOIS network to search more information, especially about human factors, such as contact, location, servers’ configurations, hosting location, etc. These information help us to find any possible data loss, and any suspicious of a targeted server or site.</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=259736#/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=259736&postid=920723</p>
											        <p>In the summary post, I have concluded cyber security threat not only technical, human factor is the biggest potential threat of cyber security.</p>

												<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion 3</h3>
												<p>Initial Post</p>
												<p>I have chosen the case: Disclosure of Personal Data via a Social Media App. I have answered all the questions which have listed on Unit 8, including:</p>
												<p>1.What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</p>
												<p>2.How was it resolved?</p>
												<p>3.If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</p>
												<p>I have given further information and opinion, in response to my tutor has raised, including:</p>
												<p>1.Who was the employee who had the applicant's details, and why was s/he in possession of such data?</p>
												<p>2.  Why was it posted to any Snapchat account? </p>
												<p>3. What data leakage controls did the company have?</p>
									                        <p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=262108</p>
												<p>Also, I have created a response to another case: Disclosure of sensitive personal data by a hospital to a third party. I have mentioned that the human error is one of the most possible cause of this breach. And the employees need to be trained and updated their cyber security knowledge, to keep their awareness to any potential cyber security breach. </p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=262576</p>
												<p>I also have mentioned, human error was the main cause to the Virgin Media case. Continue CPD – GPDR training to employees is necessary, which can help them always be aware to the privacies and personal data.</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=263187</p>
												<p>About the case of CCTV footage leaking, I have mentioned the regulations and prevention of human errors may not enough to prevent the breach, because the IoT – CCTV itself may also have security vulnerabilities, which may create any backdoor and out of controlled security breaches.</p>

												<h3>Team project</h3>
												<p>Unit 3: Scanning exercise</p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%203%20Basic%20website%20test.pdf</p>
												<p>Design Document</p>
												<p> I have involved the 3rd point of the document: a summary of recommendations and potential mitigations that could be reduce risks and comply with given standards and guidelines for the specified industry. Also, put them into an order, according to its importance. (Essex, 2021)</p>
                                                                                                <p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%206%20recommendations%20and%20potential%20mitigations%20(3rd%20bullet).pdf</p>
												<p>I have contributed added limitation and assumptions on the design document during the discussion with the team, to meet the requirements and format of the design document:</p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%206%20Limitations%20and%20assumptions.pdf</p>
												<p>The final design document:</p>

                                                                                                <p>University of Essex (2021) Development Team Project: Design Document, Available at: https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=500265 (Accessed: 26th May 2021).</p>
												<p> PEN Test </p>
                                                                                                <p>I have done the PEN test with Nessus and OWSAP ZAP, I have found most of the answers from the questions, which are listed on Unit 7, and have posted on Wiki, title: FAQ: My scan on Freya's team website (Kin Wong):</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/glossary/view.php?id=500205</p>
												<p>Development Team Project: Executive Summary Assignment</p>
												<p>I have done a 1st draft:</p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Module%202%20Unit%2011%20-%20Conclusion%201st%20draft.pdf</p>
												<p>But the team members said it was too general. Conclusion should be specifically according to the PEN test.</p>
												<p>Also, Crez has outlined a checklist of the summary. I was informed to do the summary of conclusion and recommendations, in descending order, which is based on the risk. Also, I have tidied up the reference alphabetically.</p>
												<p>I have created 3 more drafts, after the instructions have been updated:</p>
												<p>2nd draft: https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Module%202%20Unit%2011%20-%20Conclusion%202nd%20draft.pdf</p>
												<p>3rd draft: https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Module%202%20Unit%2011%20-%20Conclusion%203rd%20draft.pdf</p>
												<p>4th draft: https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Module%202%20Unit%2011%20-%20Conclusion%204th%20draft.pdf</p>
											        <p>After having tidied up and reduce the words of conclusion and recommendations, we have created a final report:<p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Module%202%20Unit%2011%20-%20Conclusion%20Final.pdf</p>
												<p>On the final report, I have evaluated and suggested more security mitigation recommendations, comparing with the design proposal on Unit 6. More recommendations including:</p>
												<p>1.	The Linux kernel should always be updated, but not only relying on the patches and updates.</p>
												<p>2.	Make sure every unused port is blocked or turned off.</p>
												<p>3.	Unused web application, especially the CMS, should be uninstalled from the web server, to avoid any unnecessary ransomware or malware.</p>
												<p>4.	Encryption should always be used, such as SSL and SSH. Unencrypted ports and services like FTP and HTTP should be blocked, to avoid any injection, loss of data and leaking. </p>

												<h3>Reflective Essay</h3>
												<p>In the 1st draft, the format of the reflection was not correct:</p>
											        <p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%202%20Module%202%201st%20Reflection.pdf</p>
												<p>In the 2nd draft, the feedback was a good technical appraisal of the latest security hardware technology, but this is still not a reflection. A reflection should include the process of my work and any problem/outcome/solution:</p>
												<p>https://github.com/kw21106/e-portfolio/blob/main/assets/Unit%202%20Module%202%202nd%20reflection.pdf</p>
                                                                                                <p>Finally, I am on the right track after have submitted the 3rd draft, lecturer replied it is a much better reflection and good work.</p>

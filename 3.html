												<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h3>
												<p>I have created an initial post, which was about a broken access control:</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=270488></p>
												<p>I also have created responses about the security misconfiguration, with comments and advice:</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=270586</p>
												<p>I also have responded to the broken authentication security issue. I suggest it should be assessed with SQL injection together, as they are related:</p>

												<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h3>
												<p></p>
												<p>I have created an initial post of the discussion:</p>
												<p>https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=273812</p>
												<p>I have discussed different cause of the risk when developing a system. For example, creating a system which will put it under a high risk, improper software design, excess resource permission to users, improper management of the software development, and the uncertainty of users/customers.</p>

												<h3>Team activity: Discussion</h3>
												<p>My opinion:</p>
												<p>Q: What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</p>
												<p>A: A programming language able to prevent any cyber security vulnerability, for example, buffer overflows, input validation issues, access control issues, cryptographic weaknesses, information leaks, insecure file operations, etc. A secured programming language should be able to hash the password and data, so that they wonâ€™t be transferred as plain text over a public network (Pillai, 2017).</p>
												<p>Q: Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</p>
												<p>A: It can. Because the newest version of Python has solved many security buys from the previous version, to prevent the possibility of cyber-attack. Also, it has libraries for encryption and hashing, to prevent the passwords and data being transferred as plain text, reduce the risk of sniffing (Pillai, 2017).</p>
												<p>Q: Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss</p>
												<p>A: It depends compare with Python, C cannot provide some new functionality, such as code reusability and OOP concepts (PSTAnalytics, 2020); but on the other hand, as Python is a very high-level programming language. We still need to rely on C on some low-level programming when trying to build an OS with Python. Also, Python needs longer CPU time for interpretation, compare with C, which will effect the OS performance if it is written by Python (Utkarsh, 2021). </p>

												<h3>Team project</h3>
												<p>Design Document:</p>	
												<p>I was responsibile to the technical challenge section. And have met the word count requirements.</p>
												<p>Team project: coding output</p>
												<p>I was responsible for the file sharing section. I have used the modules of Python, created a web interface, and able to share the image files. I have created a README.doc for the explanation of the modules, why need to use a secure port on the web surface, how will the modules, including the http server and socketserver, communicate together. </p>

									<p> Unit 3: Summary Post
									<p>In summary, as the use of internet becomes essential, more customers are shopping online, working from home become popular for the staffs. People from anywhere needs to access the company's network, from website to internal applications. SMEs should put more resource and training on cyber security due to the increasing of security threats and private data exposure.</p>
									<p>According to Sam from CyberSmart(2019), SMEs should put more resource on cyber security measure. A good cyber security deployment can protect both the company and customers, to avoid from the security threats including data leaking, protect the business reputation of the company and avoid any loss from violating the GPDR regulation because of any failed management of customers' private data.</p>
									<p>A sustainable cyber security investment can also help the company always be up to date from any latest security threat: an updated cyber security prevention deployment can discover and prevent the latest hacking, phishing techniques and malware, to make sure the company and its customer data always be protected.</p>
                                                                        <p>Besides investment to hardware and software of a cyber security deployment, a continuous professional development of internet/cyber security for the staffs and management of the company is also important. Foregenix(2018), a cyber security solution company, which has been awarded “The Queen's awards for Enterprise: International Trade 2019”, says although many small and mid-size companies have their own dedicated network security team, but the hackers always discover the weakest point to attack and steal their data. Staffs' careless or inadequate knowledge of cyber security can be the best breaking point: human error involves 95% of data breach. Training for employees is essential, and every staff should be responsible to protect the company and its customers' data.</p>
								        <p>Although VPN is one of the best solution from data breach, but who is the service provider, may make your data cannot be protected, but even exposed “expose their trusting users to surveillance and cyberattacks.” (Chandler, 2019)</p>

									<p> 3 threat modelling techniques which are commonly used in the industry: STRIDE, Persona non Grata (PnG), Security Cards:</p>
								        <p>STRIDE: One of the most mature and popular threat modelling method, which was invented in 1999 and the main user is Microsoft. STRIDE means:</p>
									<p>S=Spoofing identity: An authentication threat that any third party pretending yourself;</p>
									<p>T=Tampering with data: Anyone modifies anything on data, network etc. without permission;</p>
									<p>R=Repudiation: Someone pretends you didn't do something or irresponsible, which involves honesty;<p>
									<p>I=Information disclosure: Unauthorised access and disclose of information;</p>
									<p>D=Denial of Service: A service is disrupted due to the exhausted requests;</p>
									<p>E=Elevation of privilege: Someone has done something which is not authorised.</p>
									<p>Persona non Grata: Collect the habit and behaviour of different hackers, research their hacking techniques and skills, and then create a profile of every hacker, including their personal introduction, hacking incident records, analysis their techniques and skills, to help researchers and professionals understand their hacking style and model the relevant precaution plans and strategy.</p>
									<p>Security cards: They are used to identify any specific or unusual attack. Every card will have details including:</p>
									<p>1. Who will attack?</p>
                                                                        <p>2. What kind of system will be under treat?</p>
                                                                        <p>3. What property or asset do the hackers interested in the most?</p>
                                                                        <p>4. How will they attack? (Nataliya, 2018)</p>
									<p>In deciding what techniques to apply, we need to consider:</p>
									<p>1. professional: Will the modelling technique can help the researchers and cyber professional to understand the style and process of the threat?</p>
                                                                        <p>2. Legal: Will the modelling technique violate any regulation, eg. DSS and GPDR</p>
                                                                        <p>3. Social: Will the modelling technique can identify a specific group of hackers/attackers?</p>
                                                                        <p>4. Ethical: Will the modelling technique can reflect a hacker's behaviour, habit and outline the cause of the threat accurately? (Aidan, 2016)</p>

									<p> Unit 3: Summary Post
									<p>In summary, as the use of internet becomes essential, more customers are shopping online, working from home become popular for the staffs. People from anywhere needs to access the company's network, from website to internal applications. SMEs should put more resource and training on cyber security due to the increasing of security threats and private data exposure.</p>
									<p>According to Sam from CyberSmart(2019), SMEs should put more resource on cyber security measure. A good cyber security deployment can protect both the company and customers, to avoid from the security threats including data leaking, protect the business reputation of the company and avoid any loss from violating the GPDR regulation because of any failed management of customers' private data.</p>
									<p>A sustainable cyber security investment can also help the company always be up to date from any latest security threat: an updated cyber security prevention deployment can discover and prevent the latest hacking, phishing techniques and malware, to make sure the company and its customer data always be protected.</p>
                                                                        <p>Besides investment to hardware and software of a cyber security deployment, a continuous professional development of internet/cyber security for the staffs and management of the company is also important. Foregenix(2018), a cyber security solution company, which has been awarded “The Queen's awards for Enterprise: International Trade 2019”, says although many small and mid-size companies have their own dedicated network security team, but the hackers always discover the weakest point to attack and steal their data. Staffs' careless or inadequate knowledge of cyber security can be the best breaking point: human error involves 95% of data breach. Training for employees is essential, and every staff should be responsible to protect the company and its customers' data.</p>
								        <p>Although VPN is one of the best solution from data breach, but who is the service provider, may make your data cannot be protected, but even exposed “expose their trusting users to surveillance and cyberattacks.” (Chandler, 2019)</p>	
									<p>Learning outcome:</p>
									<p>Through the discussions with the classmates, I have learned the cyber security not only a technical issue, but only involves humans, politics, and regulations etc.</p>
									<p>Also, besides the human and law factors, the budget and funding of an organisation is another issue: many companies cannot put the cyber security as the first priority because of lacking money. This is also another factor which cause data leaking and security breach of companies are so popular around the globe.</p>
									<p>I also have learned the human factor is another biggest issue of cyber security: Both the employers and employees always overlook the importance of cyber security; many of them have no training or knowledge how to avoid a data breach.</p>

                                                                        <p>Unit 4: Seminar preparation</p>
									<p> 3 threat modelling techniques which are commonly used in the industry: STRIDE, Persona non Grata (PnG), Security Cards:</p>
								        <p>STRIDE: One of the most mature and popular threat modelling method, which was invented in 1999 and the main user is Microsoft. STRIDE means:</p>
									<p>S=Spoofing identity: An authentication threat that any third party pretending yourself;</p>
									<p>T=Tampering with data: Anyone modifies anything on data, network etc. without permission;</p>
									<p>R=Repudiation: Someone pretends you didn't do something or irresponsible, which involves honesty;<p>
									<p>I=Information disclosure: Unauthorised access and disclose of information;</p>
									<p>D=Denial of Service: A service is disrupted due to the exhausted requests;</p>
									<p>E=Elevation of privilege: Someone has done something which is not authorised.</p>
									<p>Persona non Grata: Collect the habit and behaviour of different hackers, research their hacking techniques and skills, and then create a profile of every hacker, including their personal introduction, hacking incident records, analysis their techniques and skills, to help researchers and professionals understand their hacking style and model the relevant precaution plans and strategy.</p>
									<p>Security cards: They are used to identify any specific or unusual attack. Every card will have details including:</p>
									<p>1. Who will attack?</p>
                                                                        <p>2. What kind of system will be under treat?</p>
                                                                        <p>3. What property or asset do the hackers interested in the most?</p>
                                                                        <p>4. How will they attack? (Nataliya, 2018)</p>
									<p>In deciding what techniques to apply, we need to consider:</p>
									<p>1. professional: Will the modelling technique can help the researchers and cyber professional to understand the style and process of the threat?</p>
                                                                        <p>2. Legal: Will the modelling technique violate any regulation, eg. DSS and GPDR</p>
                                                                        <p>3. Social: Will the modelling technique can identify a specific group of hackers/attackers?</p>
                                                                        <p>4. Ethical: Will the modelling technique can reflect a hacker's behaviour, habit and outline the cause of the threat accurately? (Aidan, 2016)</p>
									<p>Learning outcome:</p>
									<p>I have explored different threat modelling techniques. For example, PASTA, LINDDUN, CVSS, Attack Trees etc, besides STRIDE and security cards. I understand the pros and cons of each methodology; some methods may violate with GPDR or personal privacy. We must be very careful to decide which one is the most suitable and safe to deploy but won’t violate to any national law and regulation.</p>

									<p>How to create the cases:</p>
									<p>1. I have visited the web site https://www.visual-paradigm.com/ and download the VP UML.</p>
									<p>2. I have read through all templates. The VP software already has lots of templates for me to use. They help me to generate the diagrams easily.</p>				
								        <p>3. I also have explored different icons and functions of the VP. For example, Use case, Actor, Dependency, Generalisation, etc. I have learned the functions of each icon before starting to regenerate the diagrams.</p>
									<p>4. I have explored how to export the diagrams: It can be exported either to VP project, image, XML and Excel. There is no option export to word directly.</p>
									<p>Learning outcome:</p>
									<p>I have learned how to use the VP to create the flow diagrams. Similar as Microsoft Viso, but more options and templates for you to choose. I can reproduce the diagrams easily, by modifying the templates, including the direction signs, icons and wordings.</p>
									<p>Unit 6: Collaborative Learning Discussion 2: Week 1</p>
									<p>The first technology I want to discuss is the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).</p>
									<p>WSA is a security appliance which is aiming to defend any threat from the traffic between the clients and web sites. It is not working alone, but 24x7 communicate with the Cisco Intelligence Centre. Through the Talos Security Intelligence, Cisco can collect, analysis up to 100TB security treats and 13 billion web requests worldwide daily, getting the latest security threats information from 1.6 million cisco security appliance and 150 million endpoints, including any device which has installed the Cisco client, including the Umbrella and AnyConnect VPN.</p>
									<p>With the most update security threat information and definitions, the WSA can stop the malware and virus from any web traffic effectively, with its own Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) and Cognitive Threat Analytics. With AMP Threat Grid and Layer 4 Traffic Monitor, the WSA can receive malware samples on live, detect and analysis any hidden security threat from every network application, not just only http/https, which can be bypassed by traditional web security solutions (Cisco, 2016).</p>
									<p>The second cyber security technology is the Microsoft identity technology, on Microsoft 365 and Azure AD.</p>
									<p>Microsoft (2021) states “Identity is the new security “perimeter””. MFA is essential across the 365 and Azure platform. With conditional access, users can access both the Microsoft Azure/365 apps and On-premises AD resources at the same time with only one-time authentication, which has balanced both the cyber security protection, such as the middle-man and password brute force attack, and giving users a comfortable and seamless login experience. There are many MFA options, including security key, authenticator, tokens, etc. Which are free from the Microsoft Azure/365 platform. In the long term, eliminate passwords for authentication can avoid lots of cyber security threats, including password hacking and cracking, in order to protect the privacy and data effectively.</p>

									<p>Reflection:</p>
									<p>I have learned some more about the MFA from peer response. INcluding the network integration with MFA, how the DLP rules and regulations integrate to the MFA and make them work together. Besides MFA, IP addresses filtering also another barrier to mininise the cyber security threats. We need to combine more than one strategy on cyber security, in order to protect our users and devices as much as possible.</p>
									<p>Unit 8: Summary post</p>
									<p>In general, I agree with every post, there is nothing 100% secure for every cyber security measure, even we have applied every the most advanced and latest cyber security technology.</p>
									<p>I agree the side effects when deploying the MFA. The first issue is inconvenient to users.  Microsoft (2021) states there are various common problems which the users may have to face when deploying the MFA. For example, some users may not have a mobile device, or it is stolen or lost, which makes them cannot login and being denied accessing every network resource.</p>
									<p>Hardware and network problem may also cause disruptions for users to login. For example, mobile device and key fob failure, no internet and mobile network connection, etc. Users cannot be authenticated by SMS, phone call or receive the authenticating code, and they cannot access the network resource due to the MFA failure.</p>
									<p>Also, vulnerabilities also have discovered on MFA. ZDNet (2019) has reported the FBI has released a warning on 17th September 2019, "The FBI has observed cyber actors circumventing multi-factor authentication through common social engineering and technical attacks". The hacking techniques including:</p>
									<p>-	SIM swapping: Hackers pretend the user and called the phone companies’ customer service, in order to find any useful information to complete the SIM swap and take over the control of customers’ phone numbers.</p>
									<p>-	Man-in-the-middle attacks: Hijacking and intercept the traffic between the targeted user and web site during the MFA session.</p>
									<p>-	Phishing: By using Muranea and NecroBrowser (2019) to intercept the authentication traffic between a user and website. NecroBrowser will store the victim’s data and hijack the session cookie, and log on to other accounts.</p>
									<p>For the Cisco WSA, IP or URL reputation is only one of its Web Security Appliance Pipeline. According to Ana (2019), the every web inspection starts from Protocol, URL, AVC, Object, MIME, lastly is AMP. </p>
									<p>But I agree the WSA is data consuming which the highest model can support up to 60 Gbps. (Cisco, 2016).</p>

									<p> Personal growth:</p>
									<p>The discussion shou include more criticality and evaluation, but not only the description according to the source. Also, software security issue can be included in the dicussion, a diversed research and discussion can enrich my understanding about the cyber security issues, despite of a few factors.</p>
                                                                        <p>Unit 12: Final assignment by using Python</p>
									<p>Record of work:</p>
									<p>1. I have created 4 cyber security solutions:</p>
									<p>-	Password complexity check for users. They can check whether their passwords are easy to break or guess by hackers</p>
									<p>-	Port scan for ASMIS systems administrators. Administrators will identify which non-essential or vulnerable ports are opened, so that they can block them on the routers/firewalls/switches.</p>
									<p>-	Encryption of cookies on the communication between users and web server.</p>
									<p>-	Anti SQL injection measure on the web app.</p>
									<p>Reflection:</p>
									<p>1.	There are more security threats the solutions I have created. It can be DNS injection, phishing, data decryption between servers and users.</p>
									<p>2.	Lots of security threat are created by humans. For example, a weak password. Besides a strong password, MFA is another solution which prevents the man-in-the-middle attack, but also can help users to log in the ASMIS easier, no need to create and remember a complex password.</p>
